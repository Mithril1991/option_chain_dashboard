# NVIDIA Investment Thesis

## Metadata
- **Ticker**: NVDA
- **Company**: NVIDIA Corporation
- **Sector**: Semiconductors / AI Computing
- **Last Updated**: 2026-01-27
- **Review Frequency**: Quarterly or on material news

## Overview
NVIDIA is the dominant AI chip and computing platform leader. H100/H200 GPUs power the vast majority of generative AI training and inference workloads. The company benefits from the ongoing AI infrastructure buildout and has created powerful moat via CUDA software ecosystem.

## Bull Case

### Growth Catalysts
1. **AI Infrastructure Dominance**: 80%+ market share in AI accelerators; new H200 maintaining lead
2. **Data Center Revenue**: Highest margin business; growing 40%+ YoY
3. **CUDA Moat**: Developers, researchers, and enterprises locked into NVIDIA ecosystem
4. **Secular Tail wind**: AI adoption will drive compute spending for 5-10 years

### Tailwinds
- Enterprise AI adoption accelerating beyond cloud providers
- Edge AI requiring specialized inference hardware
- New markets (automotive, robotics, industrial automation)

## Bear Case Risks
- **Valuation**: Trading at extreme multiples; any guidance miss = sharp drawdown
- **Competitive Threats**: AMD MI300, custom chips (Trainium, Gaudi) gaining traction
- **Supply Constraints**: TSMC fab capacity could limit growth (foundry dependency)
- **Customer Concentration**: Top 3 customers (cloud providers) = 50%+ of revenue

## Catalyst Timeline

### Q1-Q2 2026
- Quarterly earnings on AI data center growth
- H200 adoption commentary
- Data center margin sustainability

### H1-H2 2026
- Enterprise AI infrastructure spending updates
- Competitive product announcements (AMD, custom chips)
- Potential new market expansion (automotive, robotics)

## IV Strategy

### Why IV Patterns Matter
- Extreme valuation sensitivity; guidance surprise = 20%+ moves
- AI sentiment swings drive sharp intraday/weekly volatility
- Earnings binary; massive move potential
- Sector leader status = broadest AI exposure proxy

### Typical IV Scenarios
- **Pre-Earnings**: IV percentile 60-80% (very elevated; binary event)
- **Post-Earnings**: IV crush 30-40% if beat
- **Sector Stress**: Correlates 0.85+ with broad tech volatility
- **AI Sentiment Shift**: IV spikes on AI spending concerns

### Options Strategy
- **Post-Earnings Short Vol**: Iron Condors after beat (multiple expansion already occurred)
- **Pre-Earnings Long Vol**: Straddles/Strangles on potential miss risk
- **Call Spreads**: Limited upside cap on valuation concerns
- **Put Protection**: Expensive but justified given downside risk

## Key Metrics to Monitor
- Data center revenue & growth rate
- Gross margin (70%+ maintained?)
- Operating leverage on fixed costs
- Customer concentration risk
- Competitive win/loss rates vs. AMD
- TSMC fab capacity allocation

## Notes
- Company is near-duopoly with AMD; hard to avoid; check correlation
- Valuation is major risk; watch P/E compression if growth slows even modestly
- Taiwan geopolitical risk is high; TSMC dependency = supply risk
- Watch CEO comments on supply, demand, and AI spending durability
