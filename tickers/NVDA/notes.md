## Strategy Ideas

### Pre-Earnings Short Straddle
**Setup**: Sell ATM straddle 2 weeks pre-earnings
**Rationale**: IV high; stock consolidated; collect premium on binary event
**Risk**: Earnings gap can exceed premium collected
**Example**: NVDA at $145, sell 145 Call/Put spread; collect $3-4/share

### Post-Earnings Iron Condor (If Beat)
**Setup**: After positive beat, sell wide condor 5-7 DTE
**Rationale**: Stock extends higher on multiple expansion; IV crush locks profit
**Win Rate**: 65-70% (historical post-beat pattern)
**Example**: If stock rallies to $155, sell 160/165 Call spread + 150/145 Put spread
