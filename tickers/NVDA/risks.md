## Critical Risks

### Extreme Valuation Risk
**Severity**: HIGH | **Probability**: HIGH
- **Description**: Trading at 45-50x forward P/E; any growth deceleration triggers multiple compression
- **Impact**: Stock could fall 30-50% from highs even with modest earnings beat
- **Monitor**: P/E trends, forward growth estimates, valuation vs. historical averages

### AI Capex Normalization
**Severity**: HIGH | **Probability**: MEDIUM
- **Description**: Cloud providers may moderate AI infrastructure spending after buildout
- **Impact**: Data center revenue growth slows from 40%+ to 15-20%; earnings miss risk
- **Monitor**: Cloud provider capex guidance, utilization rates of deployed chips, efficiency improvements

### Competitive GPU Threat (AMD, Custom)
**Severity**: MEDIUM | **Probability**: MEDIUM
- **Description**: AMD MI300 improving; custom chips (Trainium, Gaudi) gaining share
- **Impact**: NVIDIA pricing power weakens; market share loss in training/inference workloads
- **Monitor**: Customer announcements, benchmark data, market share reports

### Taiwan / TSMC Supply Risk
**Severity**: HIGH | **Probability**: LOW
- **Description**: NVIDIA's GPU production entirely dependent on TSMC Taiwan fabs
- **Impact**: Geopolitical event = supply disruption; business halts
- **Monitor**: U.S.-China tensions, Taiwan strait activity, geopolitical risk indices

### Customer Concentration
**Severity**: MEDIUM | **Probability**: MEDIUM
- **Description**: Top 3 cloud customers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Meta) = 50%+ of revenue
- **Impact**: If major customer diversifies to custom chips, significant revenue loss
- **Monitor**: Customer announcements, adoption rates of alternative chips

## Market Risks

### Tech Sector Rotation
**Severity**: MEDIUM | **Probability**: HIGH
- **Description**: Semiconductor/AI sector vulnerable to re-rating on macro shifts, interest rates
- **Impact**: Broad sector decline; NVDA down 15-25% on multiple compression
- **Monitor**: Treasury yields, tech sector valuations, market breadth

### AI Hype Deflation
**Severity**: MEDIUM | **Probability**: MEDIUM
- **Description**: If AI ROI disappoints or adoption slower than expected, sentiment shifts
- **Impact**: AI sector stocks re-rated lower; NVDA could lose 20-30% of value
- **Monitor**: Enterprise AI adoption metrics, AI project outcomes, industry commentary

## Risk Mitigation

### For Long Positions
- Use Put Spreads to define downside (expensive but prudent)
- Consider profit-taking after 20%+ gains
- Hedge with VIX calls if holding overnight through events

### For Options Traders
- Avoid short calls; upside too open-ended for certainty
- Short puts supported by technical levels only
- Iron Condors only on post-beat consolidation phases
