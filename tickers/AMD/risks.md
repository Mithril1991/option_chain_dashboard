- **Timeline**: Product availability is now; adoption metrics visible in H1 2026

### CPU Product Cycles
**Severity**: MEDIUM | **Probability**: MEDIUM
- **Description**: New CPU generations (Zen 6, Zen 7) must deliver on power efficiency, performance; any delays hurt
- **Impact**: Market share loss to Intel during launch windows, revenue timing misses
- **Monitor**: Product roadmap updates, analyst reports, competitive benchmarks

### Software/Driver Ecosystem
**Severity**: MEDIUM | **Probability**: MEDIUM
- **Description**: CUDA dominance means developers default to NVIDIA; AMD MI software ecosystem must mature quickly
- **Impact**: Lower adoption of MI300 despite technical superiority, lost revenue potential
- **Monitor**: Software developer adoption metrics, OpenCL/HIP maturity, industry conference updates

---

## Geopolitical/Regulatory Risks

### China Export Restrictions
**Severity**: HIGH | **Probability**: MEDIUM
- **Description**: U.S. restrictions on advanced chip exports to China could impact demand and foundry utilization
- **Impact**: 15-25% revenue loss (China is material market), gross margin pressure
- **Monitor**: Commerce Department policy, Chinese demand data, regulatory changes
- **Precedent**: Current GPU restrictions already constraining AI chip exports to China

### Taiwan Conflict Risk
**Severity**: HIGH | **Probability**: LOW
- **Description**: AMD's primary foundry (TSMC) is in Taiwan; conflict would halt production
- **Impact**: Supply disruption, potential business interruption, geopolitical fallout
- **Monitor**: U.S.-China relations, Taiwan strait activity, geopolitical risk indices
- **Contingency**: AMD developing contingency supply chain (diversifying to Samsung, others)

### Antitrust Concerns
**Severity**: LOW | **Probability**: LOW
- **Description**: If AMD gains excessive market dominance, could face antitrust scrutiny
- **Impact**: Potential forced licensing, market-share caps, regulatory burden
- **Monitor**: Regulatory announcements, market concentration data

## Financial Risks

### Gross Margin Compression
**Severity**: MEDIUM | **Probability**: HIGH
- **Description**: Fab costs rising (TSMC pricing), competition increasing; margins could compress
- **Impact**: Profitability miss despite revenue growth; multiple contraction
- **Monitor**: Quarterly gross margin trends, TSMC pricing commentary, competitive pricing
- **Metric**: Current gross margin ~50%; watch for dips below 48%

### High R&D Spending Requirement
**Severity**: MEDIUM | **Probability**: HIGH
- **Description**: GPU/CPU design races require sustained R&D; could limit profitability
- **Impact**: Operating margin pressured; lower EPS growth despite revenue growth
- **Monitor**: R&D spend as % of revenue, engineering headcount trends

### Debt Covenant Risk (if any)
**Severity**: LOW | **Probability**: LOW
- **Description**: AMD has manageable debt; low default risk but could face refinancing costs
- **Impact**: Interest expense increases in higher rate environment
- **Monitor**: Debt maturity schedule, credit rating, balance sheet leverage

---

## Valuation Risks

### Multiple Compression
**Severity**: MEDIUM | **Probability**: HIGH
- **Description**: Semiconductor industry re-rating; high P/E valuations vulnerable to compression
- **Impact**: Stock decline even with steady earnings; valuation reset downward
- **Monitor**: P/E ratio trends, EV/Revenue, vs. NVIDIA valuation gap
- **Current**: AMD trading at ~30x forward P/E; vulnerable if growth slows

### AI Bubble Risk
**Severity**: MEDIUM | **Probability**: MEDIUM
- **Description**: Market potentially overestimating AI capex durability; if capex disappoints, stock could fall 20%+
- **Impact**: Valuation reset on cloud capex normalization; earnings estimate cuts
- **Monitor**: Cloud provider capex guidance, AI infrastructure adoption metrics, market sentiment

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### For Long Positions
1. **Valuation Entry**: Wait for 20-25x forward P/E before adding (current ~30x expensive)
2. **Position Sizing**: 3-5% of portfolio max for cyclical tech
3. **Stop Loss**: Set at -15% from entry or technical support
4. **Hedging**: Buy Put Spreads before earnings if conviction wanes

### For Options Traders
1. **Earnings Strategy**: Short volatility post-earnings on beat; IV crush large
2. **Avoid Naked Shorts**: GPU competition too binary; upside could be sharp
3. **Call Spreads**: Cap upside but limit downside on uncertain catalysts
4. **Defensive Puts**: Buy around $90 support; AI demand shock protection
