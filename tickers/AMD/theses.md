# AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) Investment Thesis

## Metadata
- **Ticker**: AMD
- **Company**: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.
- **Sector**: Semiconductors / Technology
- **Last Updated**: 2026-01-27
- **Review Frequency**: Quarterly or on material news (industry events, guidance)

## Overview
AMD is a leading fabless semiconductor designer specializing in processors and GPUs for data center, consumer, and embedded markets. The company has gained significant market share in CPUs and is expanding AI/ML compute capabilities. The business is cyclical but benefits from long-term AI/cloud infrastructure trends.

## Bull Case

### Growth Catalysts
1. **Data Center Dominance**: Strong position in AMD EPYC CPUs with growing server market share
2. **AI/GPU Expansion**: MI300 series targeting generative AI workloads; competing with NVIDIA in AI accelerators
3. **Cyclical Upcycle**: Semiconductor industry cyclical recovery underway; capital spending elevated
4. **Secular Trends**: Cloud adoption, AI computing, edge processing all favor AMD

### Tailwinds
- Enterprise migration to more power-efficient AMD processors
- AI model training requiring high-bandwidth compute (MI300X strength)
- Company gaining design wins with major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)

## Bear Case Risks
- **NVIDIA Dominance**: NVIDIA's CUDA ecosystem and H100/H200 GPUs still dominant in AI
- **Cyclical Downside**: Semiconductor revenue highly cyclical; could face slowdown in 2026-2027
- **Design Risk**: New GPU and CPU lines must execute flawlessly; any delay loses competitive advantage
- **Supply Chain**: Foundry relationships (TSMC) expose AMD to supply constraints

## Catalyst Timeline

### Q1 2026 (Near-term)
- Quarterly earnings announcement (Feb/Mar)
- Data center revenue trends
- GPU demand indicators
- Forward guidance

### H1 2026 (Medium-term)
- New GPU/CPU product launches
- AI infrastructure build-out updates
- Market share data (server CPUs, GPUs)

### FY 2026+ (Long-term)
- Market dominance in specific segments
- Profitability expansion
- Potential strategic M&A

## IV Strategy

### Why IV Patterns Matter
AMD exhibits high volatility due to:
1. **Earnings Sensitivity**: Guidance misses cause sharp reversals (20%+ moves)
2. **Sector Rotation**: Tech/semiconductor valuation swings affect multiple
3. **Product Cycle**: New products create sharp rallies or disappointments
4. **Geopolitical Risk**: China export restrictions, Taiwan tensions impact supply/demand

### Typical IV Scenarios
- **Before Earnings**: IV percentile 50-70% (elevated); guidance surprises drive outcomes
- **Post-Earnings**: IV crush typical if results in-line; tech earnings clarity reduces uncertainty
- **Product Launch**: IV can spike pre-launch (MI300, new CPU line) on anticipation
- **Sector Stress**: AMD follows semiconductor sector (SOX index); broader tech weakness spreads

### Options Trading Considerations
- **Short Volatility**: Post-earnings after positive results on multiple expansion
- **Long Volatility**: Before earnings or product announcements (high payoff potential)
- **Call Spreads**: Bullish on secular AI trends; defined risk
- **Condors**: After earnings on range-bound consolidation

## Key Metrics to Monitor
- Data center revenue (% of total)
- GPU revenue & market share vs. NVIDIA
- Gross margin trends (foundry cost management)
- Operating expense trends
- Free cash flow generation
- Server CPU market share (Gartner/Mercury Research)

## Notes
- Watch competitive landscape vs. NVIDIA (pricing power, market share)
- Monitor Taiwan relations (geopolitical risk to TSMC foundry)
- Track semiconductor industry capex trends (SOX index companies)
- Follow AI infrastructure demand signals (cloud provider announcements)
- Valuation compression risk if AI spending slows
