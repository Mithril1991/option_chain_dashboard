## Bull Case

### Growth Catalysts

## IV Strategy

### Why IV Patterns Matter
SoFi's stock exhibits high volatility due to:
1. **Growth Stock Dynamics**: Market reprices growth expectations frequently
2. **Regulatory Sensitivity**: Banking news drives sharp moves
3. **Earnings Surprise Pattern**: Guidance revisions create IV spikes
4. **Interest Rate Sensitivity**: Fed policy directly impacts mortgage/lending spreads

### Typical IV Scenarios
- **Before Earnings**: IV percentile typically 40-70% (moderate elevation)
- **Post-Earnings**: IV crush typical if results in-line or forward guidance maintained
- **Regulatory News**: IV can spike to 80%+ on banking-related announcements
- **Market Stress**: IV follows broader market volatility (VIX correlation ~0.65)

### Options Trading Considerations
- **Short Volatility**: Post-earnings after positive results (Iron Condor, Short Straddle)
- **Long Volatility**: Before earnings or regulatory events (Straddle, Strangle)
- **Directional Play**: Bullish Call Spreads on positive catalysts; Bearish Put Spreads on support tests

## Key Metrics to Monitor
- Monthly active users (MAU)
- Member deposits and dollar volume
- Loan origination volume (personal loans, mortgages)
- Net revenue trends
- Operating expense ratio
- Deposit/liability funding costs

## Notes
- Watch CEO commentary on deposit growth strategy
- Monitor competitive landscaping (Upstart, LendingClub, affirm)
- Follow regulatory calendar for banking-related announcements
- Track correlation to broader fintech sector (ARKF ETF, Upstart, SQ)
