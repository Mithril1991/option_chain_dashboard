## Key Risks

### CEO Risk
**Severity**: HIGH | **Probability**: HIGH
- Elon's involvement in multiple ventures (X, Neuralink, xAI) may distract from Tesla
- Twitter-driven volatility affects stock without fundamental changes
- Succession plan unclear if Elon steps back

### EV Competition
**Severity**: HIGH | **Probability**: HIGH
- Traditional OEMs (Ford F-150 Lightning, Chevy Bolt, VW ID series) encroaching
- Chinese competitors (BYD, NIO) extremely competitive on price/features
- Tesla margin compression inevitable as competition intensifies

### Macro Sensitivity
**Severity**: HIGH | **Probability**: MEDIUM
- EV demand highly cyclical; recession = buyer pullback
- Luxury purchasers (current TSLA buyers) cut spending first in downturns
- Interest rates affect EV financing; higher rates = lower demand

### FSD Execution Risk
**Severity**: MEDIUM | **Probability**: MEDIUM
- Full Self-Driving remains unproven after years of development
- Robotaxi launch repeatedly delayed; timeline slipping
- Regulatory approval uncertain; liability questions unresolved

### Supply Chain
**Severity**: MEDIUM | **Probability**: MEDIUM
- Lithium, cobalt, rare earths critical; supply constraints possible
- Geopolitical risk (China dominance in battery production)
- Energy crisis could constrain supply/increase costs

### Valuation Volatility
**Severity**: MEDIUM | **Probability**: HIGH
- Stock trades on sentiment; multiple compression possible
- 50%+ drawdowns not uncommon; valuation disconnected from earnings
- No dividend; pure growth story vulnerable to rate increases

## Risk Mitigation

### For Long Positions
- Position size: 1-2% max (extreme volatility)
- Use Put Spreads for downside protection
- Consider taking profits on 20%+ rallies
- Avoid holding through earnings if uncertain

### For Options Traders
- Prefer Put Spreads (define risk); avoid naked puts
- Short straddles high risk; CEO tweet can gap stock 10%+
- Iron Condors only after earnings with wide strikes
- Consider VIX calls for portfolio hedge
