# Tesla Investment Thesis

## Metadata
- **Ticker**: TSLA
- **Company**: Tesla Inc.
- **Sector**: Automotive / Energy / Technology
- **Last Updated**: 2026-01-27
- **Review Frequency**: Monthly (volatile, sentiment-driven)

## Overview
Tesla is an electric vehicle manufacturer and energy company with expanding software and autonomous driving capabilities. The company operates in multiple high-growth industries (EVs, energy storage, solar) but faces intense competition. Stock is highly correlated with CEO sentiment and macro risk appetite.

## Bull Case

### Growth Catalysts
1. **EV Market Leadership**: Still commands ~60% of U.S. EV market; expanding globally
2. **Energy Business Expansion**: Battery storage and solar rapidly growing; potentially higher margin
3. **Autonomous Driving**: Full Self-Driving (FSD) improving; potential robotaxi launch 2026-2027
4. **Manufacturing Scale**: New factories ramping (Berlin, Texas, Mexico); cost per unit declining

### Tailwinds
- Global EV adoption accelerating (fleet electrification mandates)
- Energy crisis driving battery storage demand
- AI/ML capabilities creating software moat (FSD development)

## Bear Case Risks
- **EV Competition**: Traditional OEMs (Ford, GM, Volkswagen, BMW) aggressively entering EV market
- **Margin Pressure**: EV pricing wars reducing profitability; energy margin unproven at scale
- **Execution Risk**: FSD remains unproven; robotaxi timeline frequently delayed
- **Macro Sensitivity**: EV demand highly cyclical; luxury purchasers sensitive to recessions
- **CEO Risk**: Elon's involvement in other ventures (X, Neuralink); focus concerns

## Catalyst Timeline

### Q1 2026 (Near-term)
- Quarterly deliveries/production
- Margin guidance (pricing power)
- FSD progress commentary

### H1 2026 (Medium-term)
- Mexico factory output ramp
- Energy business growth acceleration
- FSD or robotaxi timeline updates

### FY 2026+ (Long-term)
- Robotaxi launch (if executed)
- Autonomous fleet economics proof
- Energy business profitability

## IV Strategy

### Why IV Patterns Matter
- Sentiment-driven; CEO tweets can cause 10%+ intraday swings
- Macro risk on (tech down) / off (risk-on) drives volatility
- Earnings highly binary on delivery numbers vs. guidance
- Options premiums swing wildly; high gamma risk

### Typical IV Scenarios
- **Normal**: IV percentile 40-60%; stock relatively stable
- **CEO Event**: IV spike 20-30% within hours (tweet, announcement)
- **Earnings**: IV elevated 50-70%; gap risk 15%+
- **Macro Stress**: IV can spike 70%+ if broader market corrects

### Options Strategy
- **Short Vol**: Limited use; volatility reversals unpredictable
- **Long Vol**: More suitable; straddles on earnings or CEO events
- **Put Spreads**: Defined risk essential; naked puts not recommended
- **Call Spreads**: Cap upside but limit downside on uncertain catalysts

## Key Metrics to Monitor
- Vehicle deliveries (quarterly vs. guidance)
- Average selling price (ASP) trends
- Gross margin %; target 25%+
- Energy business revenue growth
- FSD adoption rates (subscribers)
- Manufacturing utilization rates

## Notes
- CEO sentiment and Twitter activity strongly influence stock
- Watch macro risk (tech sector valuation, rates, recession probability)
- Compare to traditional OEMs (F, GM, VW) on EV transition progress
- Track battery cost trends and supply chain constraints
- Energy business profitability is key differentiator vs. pure auto peers
