## Strategy Ideas

### Put Spread (Downside Protection)
**Setup**: Buy Put Spread (buy 270 Put, sell 250 Put) for defined downside
**Rationale**: Tail risk on recession; energy crisis; competition news
**Cost**: $1-1.50/share; defined max loss
**Use Case**: Hedge for long position

### Post-Earnings Iron Condor (if Beat)
**Setup**: Sell wide condor after positive delivery report
**Rationale**: IV crush typically 25-30%; stock consolidates after gap
**Win Rate**: 60-65% if guidance firm
**Example**: After beat, sell 310 Call/320 Call spread + 280 Put/270 Put spread

## Risk Management

- **Max Position**: 1-2% of portfolio (extreme sentiment risk)
- **Stop Loss**: 20% on any directional trade
- **CEO Rule**: Monitor social media; be ready to exit on controversial tweets
- **Macro Rule**: Reduce size when VIX > 25 (risk-off environment)
